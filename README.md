Thank you for giving me the opportunity!
I didnâ€™t manage to finish the whole assignment, but I did complete the server and part of the client.
This task was a bit difficult for me mainly because setting up the project took me quite a long time.
I really enjoyed working on it, and I believe that if I had even one more hour, I could have finished it nicely.
The CSS is just to show the overall layout and structure.
I used GPT for general guidance
Thanks,
